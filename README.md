# Abalone Project

This is a Linear Regression model on Abalone dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)

Abalone is a shellfish and it's age is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope. This model tries to predict the age of the Abalone by it's external features like Length, Weight etc.

This model is coded in MATLAB
